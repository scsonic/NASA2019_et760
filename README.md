# Honeycomb Platform
In this project, we invite those who have drones to join the **Fire Bees Program**. Once they register with our system, their drones will become one of the smart wildfire fighters in our system. Meanwhile, everyone can monitor each droneâ€™s status and track the updates of a wildfire in real time.

# System
Server: Node.js
Client side: JavaScript + Google Maps API

## How to Use
